# B1G-Notify-with-Sound-Notifications

This is the version of B1G Notify (https://github.com/CarlosVergikosk/B1G_NOTIFY) modified by me, I removed the commands via chat and added some events to bring up notifications and play a sound (via Interact Sound https: / /github.com/plunkettscott/interact-sound).
