# B1G Notify with Sound Notifications

This is the version of B1G Notify (https://github.com/CarlosVergikosk/B1G_NOTIFY) modified by me, I removed the commands via chat and added some events to bring up notifications and play a sound (via Interact Sound https://github.com/plunkettscott/interact-sound).

## ! WARNING !
To play the sounds you need to load your files into Interact Sound and change their name to make it work.

### This resource is needed to make my version of es_extended work with double work ()
